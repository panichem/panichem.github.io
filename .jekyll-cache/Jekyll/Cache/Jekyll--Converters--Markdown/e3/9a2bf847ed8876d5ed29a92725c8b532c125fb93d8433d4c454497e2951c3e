I".<p>I am a neuroscientist at Stanford University. My work explores cognitive influences on visual perception and memory using a combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling. I’m broadly interested in using behavioral and neural data to constrain theories of cognition.</p>

<p>I’m currently based in <a href="https://www.moorelabstanford.com/">Tirin Moore’s lab</a> in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford Medical School. I completed my PhD at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute in 2020, advised by <a href="https://www.timbuschman.com/">Tim Buschman</a> and <a href="https://ntblab.yale.edu/">Nick Turk-Browne</a>.</p>
