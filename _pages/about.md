I am a neuroscientist at Stanford University. My work explores cognitive influences on visual perception and memory using a combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling. I'm broadly interested in using behavioral and neural data to constrain theories of cognition.

I'm currently based in [Tirin Moore's lab](https://www.moorelabstanford.com/) in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford Medical School. I completed my PhD at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute in 2020, advised by [Tim Buschman](https://www.timbuschman.com/) and [Nick Turk-Browne](https://ntblab.yale.edu/).
